        <p id="row1b">I am very excited to have been chosen for the opportunity to be in the Beta class.
        I am also nervous because I hardly have any coding experience except through Excel
        formulas like concatenation.</p>

    <p id="row2b">This past week seemed to be very fast paced. I picked up on a couple of new concepts
        pretty well but I am still struggling with most of them. I have been doing more
        independent study this week and it has been helping. I have been so filled with
        new concepts that I have actually been dreaming of different coding terminology.
        I am feeling a little more confident as I have been interacting with my classmates.
        I have found out that I am not the only one who doesn't understand some of the concepts
        that we have went over in class. I am hearing others say a lot of the things I have
        been feeling about the pace of the class as well. I do think that I still have a good
        chance of making it through the program and am encouraged to keep moving forward with
        it. I have been doing some studying over the weekend. I am looking forward to what
        the upcoming week has in store for me.

    </p>

    <p id="row3b"> We started making functions work within functions. I am feeling pressure to complete
        assignments faster. I am wondering at this point if I am going to be able to understand
        this language. I have been putting more time into independent study. </p>

    <p id="row4b">This past week was very challenging for me. I am seeing some improvement in the way I am
        completing assignments. I am at least learning to understand the requirements better
        now. At first, I was more focused on trying to get at least something done on each
        problem or exercise; but now I see that it is more important to finish one than to have
        two incomplete ones. There were still a few assignments that I was disappointed in
        myself about for not doing a better job.
        Doing the reading assignments and looking at youtube videos for clarification has
        helped out a lot. I had set a personal goal for myself to gauge whether or not I
        was making an improvement to decide whether I would stick it out. So far so good.
        At this point, I feel like I really am where I need to be mentally. I am ready to
        see what the next week brings!</p>

    <p id="row5b">This week was the hardest for me thus far. I got pretty lost when we went over adding event
        listeners. I have made this the main topic for study this weekend. Even though I am having
        some trouble, I am still confident that I can grasp the various concepts being thrown at me
        . The pre-morning study sessions are very helpful; therefore, I am going to keep trying to
        make it to them.
        I can see myself as a developer. I am a problem solver. One of my biggest problem is that
        I get distracted by others or the pressure of the time constraints and find it hard to
        complete my classwork. I am working on ways that I can stay focused and take the pressure
        of time off myself. I am determined to be one of the graduates from the Beta class this
        June.</p>

    <p id="row6b">This week has been filled with projects. We had 2 half day projects to complete Monday.
        I struggled more with the first one because I got distracted and ended up deleting my
        code because I felt as though I wasn't completing the assignment correctly. This caused
        too much of a delay in time and I never did get the game to working properly. I committed
        myself to avoiding distraction on the second half-day project. I met the requirements much
        easier.
        The rest of the week has been spent on a bigger project, Project 1. I have enjoyed being
        able to work independently at my own pace. I am also learning CSS grid and positioning much
        better. I have enjoyed having more creative freedom but I am nervous about presenting the
        project Monday. I feel I have met the requirements for content but I think my website is
        boring.
