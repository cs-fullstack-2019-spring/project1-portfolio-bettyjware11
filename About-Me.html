<h1>About Me</h1>
        <!--Paragraphs for Details about me-->
<p>
    I was born and raised in Memphis, TN. I grew up on the South side of town and graduated from
    Whitehaven High School. During those days, I was really into Spelling, Math and Art. I loved
    art so much that I took advanced placement art in the 12th grade and competed in competitions.
    I did a variety of things from oil painting to charcoal drawings. I even got into air brushing
    design for tee shirts and other items that people wanted to add that personal touch to.
</p>
<p>
    My artistic nature also led to me experimenting with different hairstyles and colors. I have tried several
    ideas on myself, family members and friends. One thing that I have found, however, is that some
    people are afraid to try a new style or hair color without actually knowing how it will look on them
    beforehand. To that extent, I plan to build an app that will allow a person to see
    a style before actually committing to it.
</p>
<p>
    I received college credit for the AP art class and went to the University of Memphis on a scholarship.
    Once there, however, my interests turned to a more practical course and I pursued Accounting as
    a major. I did this for two reasons. I loved Math and I was convinced by those around me that I could
    not make money in the field of Art. I was told that I needed to find another subject that I could
    actually get a job with. This is what I did. I graduated with a Bachelors and went to work. I
    stayed in the field of Accounting for over a decade before I finally became burnt out with the
    political nature of the job I had. I knew it was time to get back to my artistic roots; perhaps
    even merging my Accounting skills with my artistic nature to build a platform...
